As can be seen in the attached video,
I have created an app with the CRUD functionality,
which consists of managing the entry of different vehicles in 3 different locations,
in which 3 additional fields are requested, which are the brand, the model and the registration number, it has been created using python with MySQL database for Azure,
It has 3 functionalities attached which are to add, edit and delete the different entries.
Regarding the design, a CSS file has been attached with an online template, and some Javascript, to add some functionality.
